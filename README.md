# ETL_BIGDATA
This is my project, where I process customer data, specifically log_search and log_content. The goal of the project is to transform complex data into simpler data, enabling the Data Analysis (DA) teams to easily conduct analyses and generate reports. The data will be stored in a PostgreSQL database using Apache Spark
